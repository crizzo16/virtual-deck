Virtual Deck for Marvel Legendary Card Game

This is purely for use during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic. My friend and I still wanted to play Legendary, but playing it over video chat was a pain. My friend had to draw my hand, let me know what cards I had, shuffle my deck, etc. 

This lets me have my own deck virtually. This is by no means a replacement of the game. It contains only heroes (and only from the sets she has). All other aspects of the game (villains, schemes, etc.) will need to be done in-person.
